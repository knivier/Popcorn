#Popcorn 
# Project Roadmap
## Overview
Popcorn is a modular and custom kernel framework for developers. It aims to provide a simple yet intuitive environment to understand the basics of operating system development. The project includes a minimal bootloader, a kernel written in C, and some basic assembly code to get things started.

## Completed Tasks
### Initial Setup and Basic Kernel
- Setup Project Structure
- Assembly Instructions on WSL
- Building the Project
- Running the Kernel

## Features
- **Pop Module System**
  - Ability to register and execute custom pop modules.
  - Modular design to easily add new pops without modifying the existing code.

## Current Pops
### Shimjapii Pop
- **Description**: Displays the message "Shimjapii popped!!!", this is an example pop module for developers

### Spinner Pop
- **Description**: Displays a spinning loader animation with the message "Loading..."

### Uptime Pop
- **Description**: Displays the tick counter

## Pops in Progress

## Future Plans
- **Enhancements and Features**
  - Include more features and improvements to the kernel framework.
  - Add more pop modules to extend the kernel's functionality.
  - Improve the documentation and provide more detailed guides for developers.
  

## Work in Progress
- **Stabilize the Project**
  - Mark all versions as pre-releases until the project reaches stability.
  - Perform thorough testing and debugging to ensure reliability.
  - Create a working .iso file to boot into the kernel from a VM or T440p (zorinos only)

## Next Steps
- **Module Development**
  - Create and integrate additional pop modules.
  - Ensure that each module is well-documented and tested.
  - The ability to run C++ files to build the project in C++ but natively in C
  
- **Community Engagement**
  - Encourage contributions from other developers.
  - Provide clear guidelines for contributing and reporting issues.

- **Documentation**
  - Improve and expand the documentation to cover more aspects of the project.
  - Create tutorials and examples to help new developers get started with Popcorn.

## Long-term Goals
- **Advanced Features**
  - Implement advanced kernel features such as multitasking, memory management, and file systems.
  - Optimize the kernel for performance and scalability.

- **Release Management**
  - Transition from pre-releases to stable releases.
  - Establish a regular release cycle with planned features and improvements.
