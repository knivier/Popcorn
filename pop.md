The core idea is that each "pop" is a module that can register itself with the kernel. Here's how it works:

1. The PopModule structure (in pop_module.h) defines what a pop is:
```c
typedef struct {
    const char* name;        // Name of the pop module
    const char* message;     // Message it will display
    void (*pop_function)(unsigned int start_pos);  // Function that does the actual work
} PopModule;
```

2. We maintain a simple registry system in pop_module.c:
```c
static PopModule* modules[MAX_MODULES];  // Array to store all registered pops
static int module_count = 0;            // Keep track of how many we have
```

3. To add a new pop, you just:
   - Create a new .c file (like shimjapii_pop.c)
   - Write your pop function
   - Define a PopModule structure
   - Register it in kmain() using register_pop_module()

For example, if you wanted to add a new "beep" pop, you could create beep_pop.c:
```c
#include "pop_module.h"

void beep_pop_func(unsigned int start_pos) {
    char* vidptr = (char*)0xb8000;
    const char* msg = "BEEP! BEEP!";
    unsigned int i = start_pos;
    unsigned int j = 0;
    
    while (msg[j] != '\0') {
        vidptr[i] = msg[j];
        vidptr[i + 1] = 0x02;  // Green color!
        ++j;
        i = i + 2;
    }
}

const PopModule beep_module = {
    .name = "beep",
    .message = "BEEP! BEEP!",
    .pop_function = beep_pop_func
};
```

Then in kernel.c, just add:
```c
extern const PopModule beep_module;
register_pop_module(&beep_module);
```

When the kernel runs:
1. It boots up and displays the initial message
2. During initialization, modules register themselves
3. When execute_all_pops() is called, it runs each registered pop one after another
4. Each pop gets its own line on the screen (managed by the line_width calculation)

The system is designed so:
- New pops can be added without changing existing code
- Each pop can have its own styling (colors, messages, etc)
- Pops are executed in registration order
- The system automatically handles screen positioning
