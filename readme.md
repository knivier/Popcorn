# Welcome to Popcorn

I'm trying to create a simple yet intuitive kernel framework. It's still unstable and all versions will be marked as pre releases for some time.

Enjoy!

## Architecture

**Popcorn is now a 64-bit (x86-64) kernel!** This version has been fully converted from 32-bit to 64-bit architecture, featuring:
- Long mode initialization with page tables
- 64-bit GDT and IDT structures
- Support for modern x86-64 processors
- All the same features as before, now in 64-bit!

## Build Instructions

### GUI Build Tool (Easiest - Fedora)

For Fedora users, we provide a beautiful GUI build tool:

```bash
cd src
python3 popcorn_builder_gui.py
```

Features:
- ðŸš€ **Full Automation**: One-click build and run
- ðŸ”¨ **Manual Mode**: Individual build steps with verbose output
- ðŸ“Š **Real-time Logs**: See build progress in real-time
- ðŸŽ¨ **Modern UI**: Clean, intuitive interface

### Quick Start (Command Line)

```bash
cd src
./create_iso.sh    # Build bootable ISO
qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom popcorn.iso -m 256
```

Or use the convenience script:
```bash
cd src
./run_iso.sh       # Builds and runs automatically
```

### Alternative: Interactive Build System

1. Run build.sh on WSL via `./build.sh` - If you are having issues with this, use dos2unix to convert the file; GitHub seems to like putting nonunix characters in its files or something

2. Select "build kernel". This will automatically erase and build the kernel for you. If you have missing dependencies, the build should tell you. You will need NASM, GCC, LD, QEMU (x86_64 version), and GRUB tools. If you have build errors, it will not show the specific errors; use trymake.sh to have a non-fancy version of the building system

3. Run `./create_iso.sh` to create a bootable ISO, then run with `qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom popcorn.iso`

**Note:** Direct kernel loading with `-kernel` may not work with all QEMU versions for 64-bit multiboot kernels. The ISO method is recommended.

**Required tools for 64-bit build:**
- `nasm` (for 64-bit assembly)
- `gcc` with 64-bit support (`-m64`)
- `ld` with x86-64 support
- `qemu-system-x86_64` (64-bit QEMU)
- `grub-mkrescue`, `grub-pc-bin`, `xorriso` (for creating bootable ISO)

Install all dependencies:

**Fedora/RHEL:**
```bash
sudo dnf install nasm gcc qemu-system-x86 grub2-tools-extra grub2-pc-modules xorriso mtools
```

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install nasm gcc qemu-system-x86 grub-pc-bin grub-common xorriso
```

Please note, build.sh is a unix only tool (some get arounds using Git Bash) and is WSL built. Please also note, build.sh is a complete builder tool that ships with this product and should auto install any dependencies that aren't on your system. If you are encountering bugs, they will not show up on build.sh; you will get an abstracted error code. Use "trymake.sh" instead for all error codes listed (but less interactive).

If you are on Windows and don't want to use WSL (unrecommended), you can use build.ps1 inside PowerShell (5 or higher, requires external script enabling). All .ps1 build/make systems are untested and may need updating for 64-bit.

Finally, all build systems are at your own risk. I'm not responsible for any installations not working correctly nor any inconfigurations nor any other errors that may occur. This software is provided AS-IS without warranties as shown in the LICENSE (please see that). If you are on a version below v1 (so, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, etc) you are using a trial version.

Assembly instructions for linux-based systems (or WSL) without a build maker are no longer provided due to the annoyance of keeping notes UTD. They are, therefore, not being included in this readme. Look through the trymake.sh to find out how you can implement it yourself instead.

## Project Overview

Popcorn is a simple kernel framework designed to help you understand the basics of operating system development. The project includes a minimal bootloader, a kernel written in C, and some basic assembly code to get things started.

### Building the Project

To build the project, follow the assembly and compilation instructions provided above. Ensure you have the necessary tools like `nasm`, `gcc`, and `ld` installed on your system.

### Running the Kernel

After building the project, you can run the kernel using QEMU with the command provided above. This will start the system and display the kernel messages on the screen. "Pops" are modular components that extend kernel functionality without modifying the core kernel.c file.

### Architecture Overview

Popcorn v0.5+ is a **64-bit x86-64 kernel** with modern console system and modular architecture:

- Console System: A complete VGA text mode abstraction layer that handles all screen output, cursor management, and color styling. All display operations go through the console system for consistency.

- Pop Modules: Self-contained modules that register with the kernel and can display information or provide functionality. Each pop module saves and restores console state to avoid interfering with user input.

- Utilities: Shared helper functions (like delay) used across multiple modules to reduce code duplication.

- Keyboard Input: Handled through interrupt-driven system with proper IDT setup and keyboard controller initialization.

### Future Plan

The project is still in its early stages and marked as unstable. Future updates will include more features and improvements to the kernel framework.

### Contributions

Thank you to Swarnim A for showing me this intel book that made inputs possible for this kernel.
